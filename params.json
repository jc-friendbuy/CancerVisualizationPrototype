","body":"# Cancer Visualization Prototype\r\nThis project aims to create tools for visualizing and analyzing cancer data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia.  This will hopefully help identify interesting patterns in cancer behavior, which will allow us to design more effective, personalized therapy strategies for dealing with each patient individually.\r\n\r\nThis project is a member of the University of Costa Rica's RIB group.\r\n\r\n### Please note: this is in (very) early alpha stage, and not intended for any sort of production use.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots:\r\n![Histogram of correlations between copy number and gene expression](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vijkddopxxoechw/Screen%20Shot%202014-12-10%20at%2022.05.17.png?dl=1)\r\n\r\n![Gene copy number and gene expression ordered by genomic location](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ply1by5kl8988c4/Screen%20Shot%202014-12-10%20at%2022.05.59.png?dl=1)\r\n\r\n![Mixed gaussian model of gene expression](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q5ne58fm0h0gzdo/Screen%20Shot%202014-12-10%20at%2022.06.33.png?dl=1)\r\n\r\n### Copyright: Juan Carlos Coto, 2014.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
